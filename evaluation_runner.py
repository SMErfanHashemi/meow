# Assuming the original content of evaluation_runner.py
# You might need to adjust this based on the actual content of your evaluation_runner.py

# Assuming the import was like this:
# from evaluate import quality_check, quantity_check

# Modify the import statement to use the new filename
from my_evaluate import quality_check, quantity_check

# ... rest of the code in evaluation_runner.py ...

# This is a placeholder for the rest of the file content.
# You'll need to replace this with the actual code from your evaluation_runner.py
# if there's more code in this file beyond the import.
